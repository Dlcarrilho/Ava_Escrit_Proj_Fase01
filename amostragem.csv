1144900,Pension Day,"Sep 3, 2019",20000 - 50000,0,0,0.99,0,"Don't you just hate it when you need to be somewhere and those pesky old folks are clogging the sidewalks, impeding your progress? If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path.

Neon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. Outergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. PLEASE NOTE: This title is built on the Unity engine and there is a slight delay while playing if you use BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. The entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. Features full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. What do the Steam curators have to say about this title? Check it out!

231330,Deadfall Adventures,"Nov 15, 2013",100000 - 200000,4,0,19.99,0,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R.
